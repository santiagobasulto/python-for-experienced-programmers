# Python for experienced programmers

I consider myself an experienced developer (I've been coding for more than 10 years). This book is what I'd like to read if I was interested in learning Python today. The problem with most books is that they're geared towards beginners: they rarely focus on Python (its dev environment, its best practices, shortcomings, etc). They teach people **how to code using Python**, which is a completely different deal.

In this book, I assume you know how to code, you know different paradigms, and more importantly, you know how to Google. You're a capable developer trying to get up to speed with Python, this should be as concise as possible. This book is not linear.

Another big weakness of programming books is that they focus **just on the language**, when we all know that being proficient with a language is more than learning the syntax. Did you know that additions and improvements to the Python language are discussed in _PEPs_ (Python Enhancement Proposal) and you can submit your own? Did you know that the main Python conference **around the world** is PyCon and there's one in practically every country? Did you know that the name "Python" is derived from [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python), the british comedy group?

A programming language isn't just a tool, it's a whole ecosystem, is a social activity, it's a way of thinking, it's a philosophy, it's even politics.

Most books will tell you "download Python and start". Well, that's not how experienced Python developers work: we create virtualenvs, we use package locking tools like Poetry, we use pyenv to manaage multiple Python versions (oh yeah, there are multiple versions of Python and it's a big deal). Actually, "downloading Python" could even be considered an anti-pattern. I think I've NEVER just "downloaded Python".

I hope you enjoy this book and you keep it as a reference. My goal is to make it as concise as possible, cutting the BS and just giving you the facts straight so you can get up to speed with Python in the minimum amount of time.
